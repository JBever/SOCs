//! This is an implementation of a node inside a BDD (Binary Decision Diagram).
//!
//! A node is defined as 2 outgoing edges `e0` and `e1`.
//! An edge can either point to another node or to nothing (`None`).
//!
//! Because there is no formal link between node (like a pointer) an edge
//! can refer to a node id which no longer exist in the BDD if the node
//! was removed. Therefore it is necessary to clean the edges of the nodes
//! that can refer to a node that will be removed.
